For instructions on how to use these "unlocking" programs with your GoPro camera go to the YouTube channel of Peter Veng-Pedersen where you will find two YouTube videos. One giving examples of HDR photos and 4K HDR time lapse videos shot with these programs, and a comparison to what you are limited to get with the unlocked GoPro. The other YouTube video is a how-to video of using these programs with your GoPro camera.
